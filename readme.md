Wlan Password Extractor

Batch script that take the saved wlan passwords of the Windows system and create a file with the extracted information


IMPORTANT: Actually I got the profiles name doing a substring of a returned sentences... This substring is calcualted manually, so the letters of the substring are calculated for the Spanish Language of the system / cmd.
And the same with an findstr sentence, is calculated in Spanish.. So, it will not works in the other language, but feel free or improve the code!

If some improvment is done, pls share it! :D Thanks!
